## Introduction
It all started with a final project in one of the Programming course assignments. Me & 4 of my friends were assigned to create a game-themed programming using C++ language and using SIGIL library to render the game graphics. We looked for games on the internet that could be made easily because the processing time was only 3 weeks. It was a long time, but it was also our first time making something like this so we had to prepare carefully. Within a day we found the game that easy to implement and it was Snake game. 

## Building the Game
At first we thought it was easy but for 3 days we tried to make it turns out we were stuck in the array section to build the body with the addition of the SIGIL library. Finally we thought of making another game. 

My friend Gufron came up with the idea to make a game like Vermintz that comes from GameHouse. As a programmer, I thought that it would be interesting and easier to implement in the SIGIL library than the previous idea. Since it was already 4 days, we thought that the graphics should not be too high, at least it would be easy to make and interesting to look at. I thought of the Feeding Frenzy game where the fish moves and if it gets hit by another big fish then game over. I also expressed my idea and yes my friends accepted it. Finally we agreed to make the game. I'm here as a programmer and game design in terms of levels and gameplay.  My friends help in game design as well, character design and asset search.

## Gameplay - First Version
The gameplay that my friends and I thought of is that we are pearl hunters in the high seas. We will drive a small remote-controlled submarine to retrieve the pearl and return to the main ship. It sounds easy but there are other challenges that come before retrieving the pearl and returning to the top.
1. You need to avoid some passing fish. Some fish are fast. So when you pick up the pearl and return to the main ship, you need to be careful.
2. Small remote control submarines like in the real world must have batteries. When it is stationary the battery will decrease slightly depending on the level but when it is moving fast it will run out faster.
3. There are special fish such as fish that are very large or can push your submarine in some levels.

## Presentation
We completed level 5 first in those 3 weeks due to time constraints. After that we presented in front of the lecturer. The lecturer was interested in the game we made and proposed to take part in a competition at my campus called AMICTA. AMICTA is an annual competition on the campus of Amikom University Yogyakarta with many categories including games. Since we were still on fire, we took the opportunity. This is my first time to join competition.
## Upgrade Gameplay on AMICTA
The nomination selection started in about 2 weeks so we wanted to add more exciting gameplay. Here we add after passing level 5, the background of the sea will change darker and there is a mysterious big fish in the background that you will fight at level 10. There are many new challenges at level 6 and above and you will definitely be challenged if you play it. When at level 10 later, you will fight the mysterious fish to take the rare black pearl. You will be equipped with a weapon, namely a bomb planted in the sea to hit the mysterious fish in order to win. About 10 bombs need to be hit to win. If you are hit by the mysterious fish, you will repeat the 10 bombs again. We also added cheats that can be filled in to be able to jump levels quickly. We know this game is a bit difficult so we make it easy.

## Moment of Truth - AMICTA 2018
We were nominated and proceeded to the judging stage. We presented it on our campus. There were 3 judges. Me and one of my friends named Muttafiah presented in front of the judges. At the end of the session, we got a lot of feedback, criticism and questions. After that I was a bit pessimistic because many games had better graphics than us.

2 Days after the judging stage was the announcement of the winners in Cinema - Building 6 Amikom. We attended the event. When the winners' names were called, we were surprised that our names were called as merit winners or 2nd place winners with 1st place being filled by our classmates. Around 8 participants, we and our classmates took the championship.

## Closing
From here I learned that, while graphics are a plus, gameplay, concept building and storytelling are high value factors that need to be considered in game development. One more thing I learned is that confidence is the key to success. So believe in yourself.
